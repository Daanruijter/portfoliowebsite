          DAAN LAURENTIUS RUIJTER FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER <br />
          I’m very enthusiastic about web development. The combination of
          analytical challenges, creativity and the international orientation of
          the profession makes it very re- warding. Being interested in the
          structure of foreign lan- guages and having worked as an editor
          before, coding is a logical extension of my capacities. It gives me
          the oppor- tunity to continually develop myself, which I consider im-
          portant for my career. I’m open for a position in a motivat- ing
          environment where I can learn more to contribute to creating valuable
          web applications. CAREER SUMMARY 12/2019-03/2020 Ubiqum Code Academy

          mobile device) Created a travel application that shows favourite
          cities. Set up the backend with Node, Express and MongoDB. For the

          a weather API. The app dis- plays the current weather for a particular

          charts.

          JavaScript that dynamically shows API data of the US Congress and

          my capacities to refactor code and to adhere to industry convention.
